# The TypeDoc Example

Welcome to the TypeDoc example! TypeDoc is a documentation generator for
TypeScript. TypeDoc automatically documents every variable, function, and class
that is exported by your project. You can add explanations and examples to your
documentation site by adding doc comments to your code, e.g. `/** This function does XYZ. */`.

This project shows off some of TypeDoc's features:

-   Built-in support for various TypeScript language constructs
-   Markdown in doc comments
-   Syntax highligting in code blocks
